# From https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/

Initialize a swarm. The docker engine targeted by this command becomes a manager in the newly created single-node swarm.

$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.1 --data-path-addr 172.10.0.1 --default-addr-pool 40.40.0.0/24 --listen-addr 0.0.0.0:2377
If a cluster may want to have dedicated manager nodes that are not served as worker nodes. This could be achieved by passing --availability=drain

$ docker swarm join --token XXXXXXXXXXX --listen-addr	0.0.0.0:2377
If you pass a manager token, the node joins as a manager.
If you pass a worker token, the node joins as a worker.
Check if needs --advertise-addr

You can set one swarm manager; or a swarm manager + swarm worker
The manager can act as worker but a worker can't run as manager.
Manager commands can be made only on manager nodes!
DO NOT run two managers, in this case run 3, to run good with the rule of N/3+1 !

# See all nodes:
$ docker node ls

# To configure services:
$ docker service create [...]
Same sintaxe as $ docker run -d [...]
Check all options: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/

To REMOVE a cluster, take care, run node by node:
$ docker swarm leave
Or if manager:
$ docker swarm leave --force
